# RETURNEY: Semi-supervised Prediction of the Return Time of a User
Project of "Models of Sequence Data" course, Skoltech, 2020

## Problem statement
The problem is to train a model to predict web user return time using browsing histories of many users.


## Structure
- `RMTPP` - folder with our implementation of vanilla Du et al. paper
- `RNNSM` - folder with our implementation of vanilla Grob et al. paper
- `semi-supervised` - folder with our experiments on semi-supervised approaches to the problem
- `data` - folder with relevant datasets
- `references` - folder with relevant existing implementations and their descriptions
