# RETURNEY: Semi-supervised Prediction of the Return Time of a User
Project of "Models of Sequence Data" course, Skoltech, 2020

## Problem statement
The problem is to develop a model that learns to predict users' return times from browsing histories of many other users. Some users do not come back, hence, our model needs to be able to both learn from such users' data and predict that some users will not come back during some specified prediction window.


## Structure
- `RMTPP` - folder with our implementation of Du et al. paper
- `RNNSM` - folder with our implementation of Grob et al. paper
- `grobformer` - folder with our implementation of RNNSM model based on hawkes transformer
- `data` - folder with relevant datasets and helper function for their processing
- `references` - folder with relevant existing implementations and their descriptions
